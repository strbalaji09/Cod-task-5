Description:The bank application program in Java allows users to manage their bank accounts. It includes functionalities like creating an account with an initial balance, depositing money into the account, withdrawing money from the account, and checking the account balance. 

The program utilizes a `BankAccount` class to represent individual bank accounts, with methods to deposit, withdraw, and retrieve the account balance. The main class `BankApplication` serves as the entry point and provides a console-based user interface for interacting with the bank accounts. 

Users can choose from a menu of options including deposit, withdraw, check balance, and exit. The program ensures error handling for insufficient funds and invalid user inputs.
